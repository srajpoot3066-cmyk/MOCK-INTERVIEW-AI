1. The Interaction LogicTo make this work, your AI needs to follow a Listen-Process-Speak loop. It shouldn't just read a list of questions; it should analyze the applicant's previous answer to decide if it needs to ask a follow-up (cross-question) or move to the next topic.PhaseAI ActionPurposeGreetingPersonalizes the start using the Name field from the resume.Build rapport.IntroAsks for a self-introduction.Validate the resume content.Deep Dive10 Dynamic questions based on Skills, Projects, and Experience.Assess technical and soft skills.Cross-ExamAsks "Why?" or "How?" based on the applicant's specific answer.Ensure the candidate isn't faking.2. Professional Interview ScriptPhase 1: The Warm-upAI: "Hello [Name from Resume], I am your AI Interviewer for today. How are you doing today?"(AI pauses and waits for the applicant to finish speaking)Phase 2: The OpeningAI: "It’s great to hear that. To start off, could you please tell me a bit about yourself and walk me through your professional journey?"(AI listens and extracts key keywords to prepare for cross-questioning)Phase 3: The Resume-Based Technical RoundThe AI will now analyze the Skills and Experience sections of the resume to ask 10 targeted questions.Example Flow:Question 3 (Skill-Based): "I see you have mentioned expertise in [Skill, e.g., React.js]. Can you describe a challenging problem you solved using this technology?"Question 4 (Experience-Based): "In your previous role at [Company Name], what was your primary responsibility, and how did you contribute to the team's success?"Cross-Questioning (Triggered by Answer): If the applicant mentions a project, the AI should interrupt the flow to ask: "That sounds interesting. Could you explain exactly what your role was in that specific project?"3. Technical Implementation GuidelinesTo ensure your AI Avatar behaves as described, you should program it with the following "System Instructions":Active Listening: The AI must not speak while the "User Audio Input" is active. It should wait for a 1.5-second silence before responding.Contextual Memory: The AI must remember the candidate's name and the specific details mentioned in the earlier part of the call.Dynamic Questioning: * Step A: Read the "Experience" section → Ask 4 questions about past roles.Step B: Read the "Skills" section → Ask 4 questions about technical proficiency.Step C: Read "Projects/Education" → Ask 2 questions about implementation or learning.The "Cross-Question" Logic: If a candidate's answer is shorter than 10 words or lacks detail, the AI should be programmed to say: "Could you please elaborate more on that point?"
